              <b> Q. How does this work?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> You ("Person A") create a GadaBot and an
              account. (Be sure to write the provided tracking number on the
              back of your Bot!) You can color your Bot and choose a name for
              it. The city you create it in becomes its hometown. Take a picture
              or two of your Bot with the local places it visits in the
              background and write a few sentences about what your Bot got to
              see and do in its hometown. Then, mail (postal mail) your Bot to
              someone you know anywhere in the world ("Person B"). Person B then
              visits the Check In Page on GadaBots and with its tracking number,
              checks in the next place in the Bot's trip and uploads a photo or
              two of your Bot enjoying the sights of its new location. Person B
              also includes a journal entry about your Bot's visit. Person B
              then mails it to someone else ("Person C") they know and the
              process repeats.

              <b>Q. I'm ready to create a Gadabot, how do I get started?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> Great! It's easy. Register for a free account
              here. Then print out and color your GadaBot however you'd like.
              Here is a template for you to use. It's best if you can attach
              your GadaBot to some sort of firm backing like heavy paper to keep
              your robot strong and healthy. If you have access to a laminator,
              your GadaBot would love to be laminated as an extra layer of
              protection! *****IMPORTANT***** Be sure to include the tracking
              number on the back of your GadaBot. It's super important! That's
              how you can follow your Bot's fantastic voyage. The people who
              receive your Bot in the mail need it to update your Bot's trip.
              Write a journal entry about what your GadaBot saw and upload a
              picture or two of your Gadabot enjoying the sights during its
              visit with you. Then mail (postal mail) the Bot to someone else
              you know who would like to host the bot for a visit. That person
              will then go through the same process you did. We have a simple
              instruction sheet for you to include with your Bot.

              <b>Q. A friend just sent me a GadaBot. What do I do now?</b>
              <br />
              <b>A. </b> Go to the GadaBot's CheckIn page. (You'll need the Bot
              ID on the back of the Bot. Write a journal entry about what your
              GadaBot saw and upload a picture or two of your Gadabot enjoying
              the sights during its visit with you. Then mail (postal mail) the
              Bot to someone else you know who would like to host the bot for a
              visit. That person will then go through the same process you did.
              We have a simple instruction sheet for you to inlcude with your
              Bot.

              <b>Q. What if my Bot gets damaged or goes missing?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> That can sometimes be sad, but fortuntately you
              have the option to create a brand new Bot with a new name, new Bot
              ID# and a new journey. Simply register for a new account and
              create a new Bot. Or, if the Bot disappears or gets damaged during
              its visit with you can give the Bot a new body but keep its
              original name and original BotID. In this case print out a new Bot
              from our template and use the same ID as the original missing or
              damaged Bot. Try to color the Bot as close to the original as
              possible.

              <b>Q. Where does the name "GadaBot" come from?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> GadaBot is a play on words based on the term
              "gadabout" which means wanderer or globetrotter.

              <b>Q. Where did the idea of GadaBots come from?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> The 1960s children's book titled Flat Stanley by
              Jeff Brown served as original inspiration for this project. In the
              1990s a Canadian teacher named Dale Hubert originated the Flat
              Stanley Project where his students would send paper cutouts of the
              boy Stanley to people who when then take pictures of Stanley,
              write about what Stanley saw and did and then send them back
              directly to the students. We thought we could capture the power of
              the Web and have our GadaBots (Stanleys) continue on their
              journeys indefinitely instead of being sent back directly to the
              students. The Internet thus provides the way the GadaBot creator
              and recipients can see their Bots take one big multi-stop
              adventure.

              <b>Q. Who is behind GadaBots?</b>
              <br /> <b>A. </b> GadaBots was created in 2019 with love and sweat
              by Ray Wasif, Kristen Johanson, Huiying (Jojo) Wang, Stephanie
              Hutchinson, and Heidi Jansen van Rensburg as our Final Group
              Project for the University of Washington's Full-Stack Web
              Development Boot Camp. We hail from four different countries and
              are enthusiastic about spreading the interconnectedness of our
              world with the youth (and adults) of today.
