Hello!

You have received a very special type of robot, called a GadaBot. Its name is _____________. Please take good care of it.  Here's what I'd appreciate you doing.

1) On your next trip near or far, please take a photo of this GadaBot with interesting scenery in the background.   

2) Go to ****Name of GadaBots Website Here**** and with the tracking ID on the back of this Bot, update its latest trip destination.  Using the "Check in" feature on the website please update the GadaBot's location, what it saw and did on its trip, and upload the photo of the GadaBot on its trip. On this website you can see all the places this GadaBot has been and keep track of his future travels as well.

3) Then please mail this GadaBot along with these instructions to anyone in the world who would like to provide it with its next destination.
